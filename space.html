      <ul class="content-1">
            <li><p>
                Interstellar space is defined as the space beyond a magnetic region that extends about 122 AU from the Sun, 
                <br>as detected by Voyager 1, and the equivalent region of influence surrounding other stars. Voyager 1 entered interstellar space in 2012.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Scientists define the beginning of interstellar space as the place where the Sun's constant flow 
                <br>of material and magnetic field stop affecting its surroundings.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Called as Helipause. It marks the end of a region created by our Sun that is called the heliosphere.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                The Sun creates this heliosphere by sending a constant flow of particles and a magnetic field 
                <br>out into space at over 670,000 miles per hour. This stream is called the 'solar wind.'
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Inside the heliosphere, the solar particles are hot but less concentrated. 
                <br>Outside of the bubble, they are very much colder but more concentrated.

        <ul class="content-2">
            <li><p>
                A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing — 
                <br>no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light — can escape from it.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. Although it has an enormous effect on the fate and 
                <br>circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                At the centre of a black hole, as described by general relativity, may lie a gravitational singularity,
                <br> a region where the spacetime curvature becomes infinite.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                For a non-rotating black hole, this region takes the shape of a single point; for a rotating black hole <br>
                it is smeared out to form a ring singularity that lies in the plane of rotation.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                In both cases, the singular region has zero volume. It can also be shown that the singular region contains all the mass of the black hole solution. 
                <br>The singular region can thus be thought of as having infinite density.

    <h1> <center><span class="dark-matter">Dark Matter & Energy</span></center></h1>
    <ul class="content-3">
        <h2> What is Dark Energy?</h2>
        <li><p>
            More is unknown than is known. We know how much dark energy there is because we know how it affects the universe's expansion.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Other than that, it is a complete mystery. But it is an important mystery. It turns out that roughly 68% of the universe is dark energy.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Dark matter makes up about 27%. The rest - everything on Earth, everything ever observed with all of our instruments, 
            <br>all normal matter - adds up to less than 5% of the universe. 
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            One explanation for dark energy is that it is a property of space. 
            <br>Albert Einstein was the first person to realize that empty space is not nothing. 
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Space has amazing properties, many of which are just beginning to be understood. 
            <br>The first property that Einstein discovered is that it is possible for more space to come into existence. 
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Then one version of Einstein's gravity theory, the version that contains a cosmological constant, 
            <br> makes a second prediction: "empty space" can possess its own energy.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            As a result, this form of energy would cause the universe to expand faster and faster. 
            <br>Unfortunately, no one understands why the cosmological constant should even be there, much less why it would have 
            <br>exactly the right value to cause the observed acceleration of the universe. 
        </p></li>

        <img class="image-darkenergy" src="Images/Page_3/Dark Energy.jpg">

        <h2>What is Dark Matter?</h2>
        <li><p>
            By fitting a theoretical model of the composition of the universe to the combined set of cosmological observations, 
            <br>scientists have come up with the composition that we described above, ~68% dark energy, ~27% dark matter, ~5% normal matter.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Observations show that there is far too little visible matter in the universe to make up the 27% required by the observations.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Second, it is not in the form of dark clouds of normal matter, matter made up of particles called baryons. We know this because 
            <br>we would be able to detect baryonic clouds by their absorption of radiation passing through them.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Third, dark matter is not antimatter, because we do not see the unique gamma rays that are produced when antimatter annihilates with matter.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Finally, we can rule out large galaxy-sized black holes on the basis of how many gravitational lenses we see.
            <br> High concentrations of matter bend light passing near them from objects further away, but we do not see enough 
            <br>lensing events to suggest that such objects to make up the required 25% dark matter contribution.
        </p></li>
